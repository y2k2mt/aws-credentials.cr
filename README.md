Get AWS credentials in various ways.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aws-credentials:
    github: y2k2mt/aws-credentials.cr
```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

`Providers` resolves credentials in order from given` Provider`.

In the example below, at first ,`Providers` resolves credentials from EnvProvider ('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' and 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' in env) and then resolves credentials from SharedCredentialFileProvider ('~/.aws/credentials').

```crystal
require "aws-credentials"

include Aws::Credentials

provider = Providers.new ([
  EnvProvider.new,
  SharedCredentialFileProvider.new
] of Provider)

credentials = provider.credentials
# Aws::Credentials::Credentials(@access_key_id="AKIA...",@expiration=nil,@secret_access_key="mVlf...",@session_token=nil)
```

Current `Provider` implementation is as follows:
- [EnvProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)
- [SharedCredentialFileProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
- [InstanceMetadataProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)
- [ContainerCredentialProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html)
- [AssumeRoleProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html)
  - Usage: Please watch `spec/it/assume_role_with_sts_spec.cr`
- [AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html)
  - Usage: Please watch `spec/it/assume_role_with_sts_spec.cr`
- SimpleCredentials (Simply holds given credentials)
